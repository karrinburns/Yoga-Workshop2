# Yoga-Workshop2
This app is being developed by a Grade 3 class. 
The app is called 'Mood Monster's Yoga Workshop'. It is a mood management app for kids 6-10 yrs old. 
Users will select 1 of 6 moods, and the app will suggest a yoga pose to help the user manage the mood. 
The UI will consist of 9 views total (storyboard entry point, list view of 6 moods, 6 individual views for moods, and perhaps an exit or info view). The kids are almost done with the custom icons for the list view, and we have photographs of each yoga pose for the individual views. Iâ€™d like to clean up the views and remove the rating stars and replace with text the kids wrote to explain each yoga pose. You are welcome to provide input or add to the project.
